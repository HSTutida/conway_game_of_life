# conway_game_of_life
My version of the conway's game of life made in Python an pygame

"The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.[1]
The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. 
It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine." From Wikipedia 

How to Run:
- Compile and Run the main.py script. The game should start automatically
- This current version only drops 1000 random seeds on the grid and then displays the life and death cicle of the cells.

To do:

GUI interface asking what mode of operation:
- random star
- player choose a number of cells
- player choose some patterns and add to the grid as desired
